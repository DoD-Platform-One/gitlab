# Files that require bigbang integration testing

### See [bb MR testing](./docs/test-package-against-bb.md) for details regarding testing changes against bigbang umbrella chart

There are certain integrations within the bigbang ecosystem and this package that require additional testing outside of the specific package tests ran during CI.  This is a requirement when files within those integrations are changed, as to avoid causing breaks up through the bigbang umbrella.  Currently, these include changes to the istio implementation within gitlab (see: [istio templates](./chart/templates/bigbang/istio/), [network policy templates](./chart/templates/bigbang/networkpolicies/), [service entry templates](./chart/templates/bigbang/serviceentries/)).

Be aware that any changes to files listed in the [Modifications made to upstream chart](#modifications-made-to-upstream-chart) section will also require a codeowner to validate the changes using above method, to ensure that they do not affect the package or its integrations adversely.

Be sure to also test against monitoring locally as it is integrated by default with these high-impact service control packages, and needs to be validated using the necessary chart values beneath `istio.hardened` block with `monitoring.enabled` set to true as part of your [dev-overrides.yaml](./docs/dev-overrides.yaml).

# Notice about updating postgres via renovate

Currently, we do not update postgresql via renovate bot unless the [upstream gitlab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#postgresql-requirements) updates beyond our current supported version of postgres. Due to local in-place image upgrades not working because of limitations around the data directory being initialized by a previous major postgresql version, this requires a manual `pg_dump` from current & `pg_restore` to new updated postgres pod locally (RDS and other non docker DBs will do this automatically). We try to keep all local in-cluster/CI DBs on the same version and upgrade once all are recommended and tested to be on the next major version.

# How to upgrade the Gitlab Package chart

BigBang makes modifications to the upstream helm chart. The full list of changes is at the end of  this document.

1. Read release notes from upstream [Gitlab Releases](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/). Be aware of changes that are included in the upgrade, you can find those by [comparing the current and new revision](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/compare?from=master&to=master). Take note of any manual upgrade steps that customers might need to perform, if any.
1. Do diff of [upstream chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab) between old and new release tags to become aware of any significant chart changes. A graphical diff tool such as [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) is useful. You can see where the current helm chart came from by inspecting `/chart/Kptfile`.
1. Create a development branch and merge request tied to the Repo1 issue created for the Gitlab package upgrade.  The association between the branch and the issue can be made by prefixing the branch name with the issue number, e.g. `56-update-gitlab-package`. DO NOT create a branch if working `renovate/ironbank`. Continue edits on `renovate/ironbank`.
1. From the root of this repository, sync the BigBang Gitlab package chart with the upstream Gitlab chart using `kpt pkg update chart@<target version> --strategy alpha-git-patch`.  Please note that `kpt` > v1.0.0 does *NOT* support this update strategy, and the latest `kpt` version that does is `0.39.2`.
1. Resolve any conflicts that may occur during the `kpt pkg update` process. A graphical diff tool like [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) is useful. Reference the "Modifications made to upstream chart" section below. Be careful not to overwrite Big Bang Package changes that need to be kept. Note that some files will have combinations of changes that you will overwrite and changes that you keep. Stay alert. The hardest file to update is the `/chart/values.yaml` because the changes are many and complicated.  Once conflicts have been resolved, use `git add` to add the files with resolved conflicts before running `git am --continue` to proceed.
1. Delete all the `/chart/charts/*.tgz` files and the `/chart/requirements.lock`. You will replace these files in a later step.
1. In `/chart/requirements.yaml` update the gluon library to the latest version.
1. Run a helm dependency command to update the `chart/charts/*.tgz` archives and create a new requirements.lock file. You will commit the tar archives along with the requirements.lock that was generated.

    ```bash
    helm dependency update ./chart
    ```

1. In `/chart/values.yaml` update all the gitlab image tags to the new version. There are about 12 of them. Renovate might have already done this for you.
1. Update `/CHANGELOG.md` with an entry for "upgrade Gitlab to app version X.X.X chart version X.X.X-bb.X". Or, whatever description is appropriate.
1. Update the `/README.md` following the [gluon library script](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/library-charts/gluon/-/blob/master/docs/bb-package-readme.md).
1. Update `/chart/Chart.yaml` to the appropriate versions. The annotation version should match the `appVersion`.

    ```yaml
    version: X.X.X-bb.X
    appVersion: X.X.X
    annotations:
      dev.bigbang.mil/applicationVersions: |
        - Gitlab: X.X.X
    ```

1. Update `annotations.helm.sh/images` section in `/chart/Chart.yaml` to fix references to updated packages (if needed).
1. Use a development environment to deploy and test Gitlab. See more detailed testing instructions below. Also test with gitlab-runner to make sure it still works with the new Gitlab version. Also test an upgrade by deploying the old version first and then deploying the new version.
1. When the Package pipeline runs expect the cypress tests to fail due to UI changes. Note that most of the cypress test files are synced to the gitlab-runner Package to avoid having two different versions of the same tests. There is one place in particular that frequently fails because the button id number `button[id="__BVID__XX__BV_toggle_"]` changes in `/chart/tests/cypress/03-gitlab-login.spec.js`. It is usually necessary to run the cypress tests locally in order to troubleshoot a failing test. The following steps are about how to set up local cypress testing. There is not good documentation anywhere else so it is included here.
    1. [Install a current version of cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#npm-install) on your workstation.
    1. Make a sibling directory named `cypress` next to where you have gitlab repo cloned.

        ```bash
        mkdir cypress
        ls -l
        drwxrwxr-x cypress
        drwxrwxr-x gitlab
        ```

        Inside the cypress directory create a symbolic link named `integration` that points to the cypress tests inside the gitlab repo.

        ```bash
        cd cypress
        ln -s ../gitlab/chart/tests/cypress integration
        ls -l
        lrwxrwxrwx integration -> ../gitlab/chart/tests/cypress/
        cd ..
        ```

    1. Export the environment variables that are needed by the cypress test. Reference the `bbtests:` at the end of `/chart/values.yaml`.

        ```bash
        export cypress_url=https://gitlab.dev.bigbang.mil
        export cypress_gitlab_first_name=test
        export cypress_gitlab_last_name=user
        export cypress_gitlab_username=testuser
        export cypress_gitlab_email=testuser@example.com
        export cypress_gitlab_project=my-awesome-project

        # actual user password doesn't matter much but gitlab rejects it if it's too simple
        export cypress_gitlab_password=aa32b3ba7d5bbf537d745fd62469b15b

        # fetch gitlab admin password via CLI:
        #   kubectl -n gitlab get secrets gitlab-gitlab-initial-root-password -ojson | jq .data.password -r | base64 -d | pbcopy 
        export cypress_adminpassword=put-the-gitlab-root-password-here
        ```

    1. Run cypress from the parent directory of the gitlab and cypress directories.

        ```bash
        cypress
        ```

    1. When Cypress launches select the same directory where you ran cypress and you should see the gitlab cypress tests listed. Run them manually, in order, one at a time.
    1. Investigate and fix errors in the cypress tests. You can run a separate browser with developer tools to find out names of elements on each page.
1. Update the `/README.md` and `/CHANGELOG.md` again if you have made any additional changes during the upgrade/testing process.

# Testing new Gitlab version

1. Create a k8s dev environment. One option is to use the Big Bang [k3d-dev.sh](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/bigbang/-/tree/master/docs/developer/scripts) with no arguments which will give you the default configuration. The following steps assume you are using the script.
1. Follow the instructions at the end of the script to connect to the k8s cluster and install flux.
   1. Deploy gitlab with the dev values overrides from [docs/dev-overrides.yaml](./dev-overrides.yaml). Core apps are disabled for quick deployment.
   1. Example helm upgrade command (run from within your local checkout of the `bigbang` repository):

    ```shell
    helm upgrade -n bigbang --create-namespace --install \
     bigbang ./chart \
     -f https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/raw/master/tests/test-values.yaml \
     -f https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/product/packages/gitlab/-/blob/main/docs/dev-overrides.yaml \
     --set addons.gitlab.git.branch=YOUR-WORKING-BRANCH-NAME-HERE
   ```

1. Access Gitlab UI from a browser and login with SSO (to learn about deploying GitLab with a dev version of Keycloak, see [keycloak-dev.md](./keycloak-dev.md)).
1. Test changing your profile image.
1. In your profile create an access token with all privileges. Save the token for later use.
1. Create a group called `test`.
1. Create a project called `test1` with a README.md within the `test` group.
1. From your workstation git clone with https the test1 project.

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.dev.bigbang.mil/test/test1.git
    ```

1. Make a change to README.md and commit and push. Verify that the change shows in Gitlab UI.
1. Test pushing and pulling an image to the project container registry. Use the access token you created.

    ```bash
    docker login registry.dev.bigbang.mil
    docker pull busybox
    docker tag busybox:latest registry.dev.bigbang.mil/test/test1:latest
    docker push registry.dev.bigbang.mil/test/test1:latest
    docker image rm busybox:latest
    docker image rm registry.dev.bigbang.mil/test/test1:latest
    docker pull registry.dev.bigbang.mil/test/test1:latest
    ```

1. Test a pipeline with gitlab-runner. Navigate to `https://gitlab.dev.bigbang.mil/test/test1/-/settings/ci_cd` and disable the Auto DevOps. Navigate to `https://gitlab.dev.bigbang.mil/test/test1/-/ci/editor?branch_name=main` and configure a pipeline. Verify that it completes successfully at `https://gitlab.dev.bigbang.mil/test/test1/-/pipelines`.

   ```yaml
    stages:
      - test
    dogfood:
      stage: test
      script:
        - echo "dogfood" >> file.txt
      artifacts:
        paths:
          - file.txt
    cache:
      paths:
        - file.txt
    ```

1. Perform a manual upgrade test. First deploy the current Gitlab version. Then deploy your development branch. Verify that the upgrade is successful.
1. Retest with monitoring and logging enabled. Verify that the logging and monitoring are working.

  ```

## chart/charts/gitlab/charts/toolbox/templates/deployment.yaml

- Added volumeMount and volume for custom ruby script configmap
  volumeMounts:
  
  ```yaml
  ...
              {{- if .Values.customScripts }}
            - name: {{ template "fullname" . }}-custom-scripts
              mountPath: /scripts/custom

## chart/charts/gitlab/charts/gitlab-pages/templates/service-custom-domains.yaml

- Ensure the conditional checking for empty `$externalAddresses` is removed from above the entirety of the template, and instead above the first use of it where it checks if the length of the value is `>1`. Add a closing `{{- end }}` after the existing `{{- else }}` and `{{- end }}` around the `loadBalancerIP:` & `externalIPs:` entries.

  ```yaml
  {{- if not (empty ($externalAddresses)) -}}
  {{-   if len $externalAddresses | eq 1 }}
  ...
  {{- end }}
  ```
