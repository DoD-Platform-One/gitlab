# GitLab Cloud Native Chart 8.0

Along with the `17.0` release of GitLab, we have bumped the chart version to `8.0`.

## Summary of major changes

- The legacy runner registration workflow is now disabled by default. [Manual action is needed to migrate to the new registration workflow.](#runner-workflow-changes).
- Support for PostgreSQL 13 has been removed. Make sure you are running PostgreSQL 14 or newer before upgrading.

See [GitLab 17 changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/versions/gitlab_17_changes.html#1700) for all upgrade relevant changes.

## Upgrade path from 7.x

To upgrade to the `8.0` version of the chart, you first need to upgrade to the latest `7.11.x`
release of the chart. Check the [version mapping details](../installation/version_mappings.md) for the latest patch.

### Upgrade to 8.5.x

If you haven't modified the GitLab chart `nginx-ingress.rbac.create` value, or it's set to `true`,
you can skip this section.

In v8.5.0, the Ingress NGINX Controller image was bumped to v1.11.2, but the Ingress NGINX Controller chart version is
still on 4.0.6. The old `v1.3.1` controller image is now deprecated and schedule for removal in GitLab chart 8.8.

By default the `v1.11.2` will be set. The chart will automatically fallback to `v1.3.1` if the you're setting
`nginx-ingress.rbac.create` to `false`. This is because `v1.11.2` requires new RBAC rules, which we added to our
[NGINX forked chart](../charts/nginx/fork.md).

If you're using managing NGINX RBAC rules by yourself, and want to use the new `v1.11.2`, apply
[the new RBAC rules to your cluster](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/3901/diffs?commit_id=93a3cbdb5ad83db95e12fa6c2145df0800493d8b)
, and enable `v1.11.2` with:

```yaml
nginx-ingress:
  rbac:
    create: false
  controller:
    image:
      disableFallback: true
```

If you're setting `nginx-ingress-geo.rbac.create: false`, the same applies.

### Runner workflow changes

The legacy runner registration workflow is now disabled by default. You must
[migrate to the new registration workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/tutorials/automate_runner_creation/index.html)
or [re-enable the legacy workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/continuous_integration.html#enable-runner-registrations-tokens).

Refer to the [runner sub-chart documentation](../charts/gitlab/gitlab-runner/index.md#requirements)
for migration instructions.
