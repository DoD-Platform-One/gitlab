# GitLab Cloud Native Chart 8.0

Along with the `17.0` release of GitLab, we have bumped the chart version to `8.0`.

## Summary of major changes

- The legacy runner registration workflow is now disabled by default. [Migrate to the new registration workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.html)
  or [re-enable the legacy workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/continuous_integration.html#enable-runner-registrations-tokens).
- Support for PostgreSQL 13 has been removed. Make sure you are running PostgreSQL 14 or newer before upgrading.

See [GitLab 17 changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/versions/gitlab_17_changes.html#1700) for all upgrade relevant changes.

## Upgrade path from 7.x

To upgrade to the `8.0` version of the chart, you first need to upgrade to the latest `7.11.x`
release of the chart. Check the [version mapping details](../installation/version_mappings.md) for the latest patch.
