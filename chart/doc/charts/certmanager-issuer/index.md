# Using certmanager-issuer for CertManager Issuer creation **(FREE SELF)**

This chart is a helper for [Jetstack's CertManager Helm chart](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/).
It automatically provisions an Issuer object, used by CertManager when requesting TLS certificates for
GitLab Ingresses.

## Configuration

We describe all the major sections of the configuration below. When configuring
from the parent chart, these values are:

```yaml
certmanager-issuer:
  # Configure an ACME Issuer in cert-manager. Only used if global.ingress.configureCertmanager is true.
  server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

  # Provide an email to associate with your TLS certificates
  # email:

  rbac:
    create: true

  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 50m

  # Priority class assigned to pods
  priorityClassName: ""

  common:
    labels: {}
```

## Installation parameters

This table contains all the possible charts configurations that can be supplied
to the `helm install` command using the `--set` flags:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `server` | `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` | Let's Encrypt server for use with the [ACME CertManager Issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/). |
| `email` | | You must provide an email to associate with your TLS certificates. Let's Encrypt uses this address to contact you about expiring certificates, and issues related to your account. |
| `rbac.create` | `true` | When `true`, creates RBAC-related resources to allow for manipulation of CertManager Issuer objects. |
| `resources.requests.cpu` | `50m` | Requested CPU resources for the Issuer creation Job. |
| `common.labels` | | Common labels to apply to the ServiceAccount, Job, ConfigMap, and Issuer. |
| `priorityClassName` | | [Priority class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/) assigned to pods. |
