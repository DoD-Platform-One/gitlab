# Manage the container registry metadata database

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5521) in GitLab 16.4 as a [beta](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/experiment-beta-support.html#beta) feature.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/423459) in GitLab 17.3.

The metadata database enables many new registry features, including
online garbage collection, and increases the efficiency of many registry operations.
This page contains information on how to create the database.

## Metadata database feature support

You can migrate existing registries to the metadata database, and use online garbage collection.

Some database-enabled features are only enabled for GitLab.com and automatic database provisioning for
the registry database is not available. Review the feature support section in the
[administration documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry_metadata_database.html#metadata-database-feature-support)
for the status of features related to the container registry database.

## Create the database

Follow the steps below to manually create the database and role.

NOTE:
These instructions assume you are using the bundled PostgreSQL server. If you are using your own server,
there will be some variation in how you connect.

1. Create the secret with the database password:

   ```shell
   kubectl create secret generic RELEASE_NAME-registry-database-password --from-literal=password=randomstring
   ```

1. Log into your database instance:

   ```shell
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=postgresql -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name --no-headers) -- bash
   ```

   ```shell
   PGPASSWORD=${POSTGRES_POSTGRES_PASSWORD} psql -U postgres -d template1
   ```

1. Create the database user:

   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE registry WITH LOGIN;
   ```

1. Set the database user password.

   1. Fetch the password:

      ```shell
      kubectl get secret RELEASE_NAME-registry-database-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode
      ```

   1. Set the password in the `psql` prompt:

      ```sql
      \password registry
      ```

1. Create the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE registry WITH OWNER registry;
   ```

1. Safely exit from the PostgreSQL command line and then from the container using `exit`:

   ```shell
   template1=# exit
   ...@gitlab-postgresql-0/$ exit
   ```

## Enable the metadata database for Helm charts installations

Prerequisites:

- GitLab 17.3 or later.
- PostgreSQL database version 12 or later, accessible from the registry pods.
- Access to the Kubernetes cluster and the Helm deployment locally.
- SSH access to the registry pods.

Follow the instructions that match your situation:

- [New installation](#new-installations) or enabling the container registry for the first time.
- Migrate existing container images to the metadata database:
  - [One-step migration](#one-step-migration). Only recommended for relatively small registries or no requirement to avoid downtime.
  - [Three-step migration](#three-step-migration). Recommended for larger container registries.

NOTE:
For a list of import times for various test and user registries, see [this table in issue 423459](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/423459#completed-tests-and-user-reports). Your registry deployment is unique, and your import times might be longer than those reported in the issue.

### Before you start

Read the [before you start](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry_metadata_database.html#before-you-start)
section of the Registry administration guide.

### New installations

To enable the database:

1. [Create the database and Kubernetes secret](#create-the-database).
1. Get the current Helm values for your release and save them to a file.
   For example, for a release named `gitlab` and a file named `values.yml`:

   ```shell
   helm get values gitlab > values.yml
   ```

1. Add the following lines to your `values.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   registry:
     enabled: true
     database:
       enabled: true
       name: registry  # must match the database name you created above
       user: registry  # must match the database username you created above
       password:
         secret: gitlab-registry-database-password # must match the secret name
         key: password  # must match the secret key to read the password from
       sslmode: verify-full
       ssl:
         secret: gitlab-registry-postgresql-ssl # you will need to create this secret manually
         clientKey: client-key.pem
         clientCertificate: client-cert.pem
         serverCA: server-ca.pem
       migrations:
         enabled: true  # this option will execute the schema migration as part of the registry deployment
   ```

1. Optional. You can verify the schema migrations have been applied properly.
   You can either:
   - Review the log output of the migrations job, for example:

     ```shell
     kubectl logs jobs/gitlab-registry-migrations-1
     ...
     OK: applied 154 migrations in 13.752s
     ```

   - Or, connect to the Postgres database and query the `schema_migrations` table:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM schema_migrations;
     ```

     Ensure the `applied_at` column timestamp is filled for all rows.

The registry is ready to use the metadata database!

### Existing registries

You can migrate your existing container registry data in one step or three steps.
A few factors affect the duration of the migration:

- The size of your existing registry data.
- The specifications of your PostgresSQL instance.
- The number of registry pods running in your cluster.
- Network latency between the registry, PostgresSQL and your configured Object Storage.

NOTE:
Work to automate the migration process is being tracked in [issue 5293](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/5293).

#### Requirements

You must complete the following steps before attempting the one-step or
three-step migration:

1. [Create the database and Kubernetes secret](#create-the-database).
1. Get the current Helm values for your release and save them into a file.
   For example, for a release named `gitlab` and a file named `values.yml`:

   ```shell
   helm get values gitlab > values.yml
   ```

#### One-step migration

When doing a one-step migration, be aware that:

- The registry must remain in `read-only` mode during the migration.
- If the Pod where the migration is being executed is terminated,
  you have to completely restart the process. The work to improve this process is tracked in
  [issue 5293](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/5293).

To migrate existing container registry to the metadata database in one step:

1. Follow the steps described in the [requirements section](#requirements).
1. Find the `registry:` section in the `values.yml` file and add the `database` section.
   Set:
   - `database.configure` to `true`.
   - `database.enabled` to `false`.
   - `maintenance.readonly.enabled` to `true`.
   - `migrations.enabled` to `true`.

   ```yaml
   registry:
     enabled: true
     maintenance:
       readonly:
         enabled: true  # must remain set to true while the migration is executed
     database:
       configure: true  # must be true for the migration step
       enabled: false  # must be false!
       name: registry  # must match the database name you created above
       user: registry  # must match the database username you created above
       password:
         secret: gitlab-registry-database-password  # must match the secret name
         key: password  # must match the secret key to read the password from
       sslmode: verify-full  # SSL connection mode. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION for more options.
       ssl:
         secret: gitlab-registry-postgresql-ssl  # you will need to create this secret manually
         clientKey: client-key.pem
         clientCertificate: client-cert.pem
         serverCA: server-ca.pem
       migrations:
         enabled: true  # this option will execute the schema migration as part of the registry deployment
   ```

1. Upgrade your Helm installation to apply changes in your deployment:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade gitlab gitlab/gitlab -f values.yml
   ```

1. Connect to one of the registry pods via SSH, for example for a pod named `gitlab-registry-5ddcd9f486-bvb57`:

   ```shell
   kubectl exec -ti gitlab-registry-5ddcd9f486-bvb57 bash
   ```

1. Change to the home directory and then run the following command:

   ```shell
   cd ~
   /usr/bin/registry database import /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
   ```

1. If the command completed successfully, all images are now fully imported. You
   can now enable the database and turn off read-only mode in the configuration:

   ```yaml
   registry:
     enabled: true
     maintenance:
       readonly:
         enabled: false
     database:
       configure: true  # once database.enabled is set to true, this option can be removed
       enabled: true
       name: registry
       user: registry
       password:
         secret: gitlab-registry-database-password
         key: password
       migrations:
         enabled: true
   ```

1. Upgrade your Helm installation to apply changes in your deployment:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade gitlab gitlab/gitlab -f values.yml
   ```

You can now use the metadata database for all operations!

#### Three-step migration

You can migrate existing container registry data to the metadata database in three separate steps,
which is recommended if:

- The registry contains a large amount of data.
- You need to minimize downtime during the migration.

To migrate in three steps, you must:

1. Pre-import repositories
1. Import all repository data
1. Import common blobs

NOTE:
Users have reported step one import completed at [rates of 2 to 4 TB per hour](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/423459).
At the slower speed, registries with over 100TB of data could take longer than 48 hours.

##### Step 1. Pre-import repositories

For larger instances, this process can take hours or even days to complete, depending
on the size of your registry. You can still use the registry during this process.

WARNING:
It is [not yet possible](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/1162)
to restart the migration, so it's important to let the migration run to completion.
If you must halt the operation, you have to restart this step.

1. Follow the steps described in the [requirements section](#requirements).
1. Find the `registry:` section in the `values.yml` file and add the `database` section.
   Set:
   - `database.configure` to `true`.
   - `database.enabled` to `false`.
   - `migrations.enabled` to `true`.

   ```yaml
   registry:
     enabled: true
     database:
       configure: true
       enabled: false  # must be false!
       name: registry  # must match the database name you created above
       user: registry  # must match the database username you created above
       password:
         secret: gitlab-registry-database-password  # must match the secret name
         key: password  # must match the secret key to read the password from
       sslmode: verify-full  # SSL connection mode. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION for more options.
       ssl:
         secret: gitlab-registry-postgresql-ssl  # you will need to create this secret manually
         clientKey: client-key.pem
         clientCertificate: client-cert.pem
         serverCA: server-ca.pem
       migrations:
         enabled: true  # this option will execute the schema migration as part of the registry deployment
   ```

1. Save the file and upgrade your Helm installation to apply changes in your deployment:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade gitlab gitlab/gitlab -f values.yml
   ```

1. Connect to one of the registry pods with SSH. For example, for a pod named `gitlab-registry-5ddcd9f486-bvb57`:

   ```shell
   kubectl exec -ti gitlab-registry-5ddcd9f486-bvb57 bash
   ```

1. Change to the home directory and then run the following command:

   ```shell
   cd ~
   /usr/bin/registry database import --step-one /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
   ```

The first step is complete when the `registry import complete` displays.

NOTE:
You should try to schedule the following step as soon as possible
to reduce the amount of downtime required. Ideally, less than one week
after step one completes. Any new data written to the registry before the next step
causes that step to take more time.

##### Step 2. Import all repository data

This step requires the registry to be set in `read-only` mode.
Allow enough time for downtime during this process.

1. Set the registry to `read-only` mode
   in your `values.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   registry:
     enabled: true
     maintenance:
       readonly:
         enabled: true   # must be true!
     database:
       configure: true
       enabled: false  # must be false!
       name: registry  # must match the database name you created above
       user: registry  # must match the database username you created above
       password:
         secret: gitlab-registry-database-password  # must match the secret name
         key: password  # must match the secret key to read the password from
       sslmode: verify-full  # SSL connection mode. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION for more options.
       ssl:
         secret: gitlab-registry-postgresql-ssl  # you will need to create this secret manually
         clientKey: client-key.pem
         clientCertificate: client-cert.pem
         serverCA: server-ca.pem
       migrations:
         enabled: true  # this option will execute the schema migration as part of the registry deployment
   ```

1. Save the file and upgrade your Helm installation to apply changes in your deployment:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade gitlab gitlab/gitlab -f values.yml
   ```

1. Connect to one of the registry pods with SSH. For example, for a pod named `gitlab-registry-5ddcd9f486-bvb57`:

   ```shell
   kubectl exec -ti gitlab-registry-5ddcd9f486-bvb57 bash
   ```

1. Change to the home directory and then run the following command:

   ```shell
   cd ~
   /usr/bin/registry database import --step-two /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
   ```

1. If the command completed successfully, all images are now fully imported. You
   can now enable the database and turn off read-only mode in the configuration:

   ```yaml
   registry:
     enabled: true
     maintenance:        # this section can be removed
       readonly:
         enabled: false
     database:
       configure: true  # once database.enabled is set to true, this option can be removed
       enabled: true   # must be true!
       name: registry  # must match the database name you created above
       user: registry  # must match the database username you created above
       password:
         secret: gitlab-registry-database-password  # must match the secret name
         key: password  # must match the secret key to read the password from
       sslmode: verify-full  # SSL connection mode. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION for more options.
       ssl:
         secret: gitlab-registry-postgresql-ssl  # you will need to create this secret manually
         clientKey: client-key.pem
         clientCertificate: client-cert.pem
         serverCA: server-ca.pem
       migrations:
         enabled: true  # this option will execute the schema migration as part of the registry deployment
   ```

1. Save the file and upgrade your Helm installation to apply changes in your deployment:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade gitlab gitlab/gitlab -f values.yml
   ```

You can now use the metadata database for all operations!

##### Step 3. Import common blobs

The registry is now fully using the database for its metadata, but it
does not yet have access to any potentially unused layer blobs.

To complete the process, run the final step of the migration:

```shell
cd ~
/usr/bin/registry database import --step-three /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
```

After the command completes successfully, the registry is now fully migrated to the database!
