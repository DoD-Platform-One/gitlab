# Using the GitLab-Zoekt chart **(PREMIUM SELF)**

The Zoekt integration provides support for
[Exact code search](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/exact_code_search.html).
This can be installed by setting `gitlab-zoekt.installed` to `true`. For now
this does not configure GitLab to automatically discover Zoekt and this feature
is experimental and disabled by default. More details on configuration can be
found in the
[`gitlab-zoekt` chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-native/charts/gitlab-zoekt).
