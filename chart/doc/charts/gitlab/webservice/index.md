# Using the GitLab Webservice chart **(FREE SELF)**

The `webservice` sub-chart provides the GitLab Rails webserver with two Webservice workers
per pod, which is the minimum necessary for a single pod to be able to serve any web request in GitLab.

The pods of this chart make use of two containers: `gitlab-workhorse` and `webservice`.
[GitLab Workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/workhorse) listens on
port `8181`, and should _always_ be the destination for inbound traffic to the pod.
The `webservice` houses the GitLab [Rails codebase](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab),
listens on `8080`, and is accessible for metrics collection purposes.
`webservice` should never receive normal traffic directly.

## Requirements

This chart depends on Redis, PostgreSQL, Gitaly, and Registry services, either as
part of the complete GitLab chart or provided as external services reachable from
the Kubernetes cluster this chart is deployed onto.

## Configuration

The `webservice` chart is configured as follows: [Global settings](#global-settings),
[Deployments settings](#deployments-settings), [Ingress settings](#ingress-settings), [External services](#external-services), and
[Chart settings](#chart-settings).

## Installation command line options

The table below contains all the possible chart configurations that can be supplied
to the `helm install` command using the `--set` flags.

## Chart configuration examples

### extraEnv

`extraEnv` allows you to expose additional environment variables in all containers in the pods.

Below is an example use of `extraEnv`:

```yaml
extraEnv:
  SOME_KEY: some_value
  SOME_OTHER_KEY: some_other_value
```

When the container is started, you can confirm that the environment variables are exposed:

```shell
env | grep SOME
SOME_KEY=some_value
SOME_OTHER_KEY=some_other_value
```

### extraEnvFrom

`extraEnvFrom` allows you to expose additional environment variables from other data sources in all containers in the pods.
Subsequent variables can be overridden per [deployment](#deployments-settings).

Below is an example use of `extraEnvFrom`:

```yaml
extraEnvFrom:
  MY_NODE_NAME:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: spec.nodeName
  MY_CPU_REQUEST:
    resourceFieldRef:
      containerName: test-container
      resource: requests.cpu
  SECRET_THING:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: special-secret
      key: special_token
      # optional: boolean
deployments:
  default:
    extraEnvFrom:
      CONFIG_STRING:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: useful-config
          key: some-string
          # optional: boolean
```

### image.pullSecrets

`pullSecrets` allows you to authenticate to a private registry to pull images for a pod.

Additional details about private registries and their authentication methods can be
found in [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod).

Below is an example use of `pullSecrets`:

```yaml
image:
  repository: my.webservice.repository
  pullPolicy: Always
  pullSecrets:
  - name: my-secret-name
  - name: my-secondary-secret-name
```

### tolerations

`tolerations` allow you schedule pods on tainted worker nodes

Below is an example use of `tolerations`:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "node_label"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
- key: "node_label"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoExecute"
```

### annotations

`annotations` allows you to add annotations to the Webservice pods. For example:

```yaml
annotations:
  kubernetes.io/example-annotation: annotation-value
```

### strategy

`deployment.strategy` allows you to change the deployment update strategy. It defines how the pods will be recreated when deployment is updated. When not provided, the cluster default is used.
For example, if you don't want to create extra pods when the rolling update starts and change max unavailable pods to 50%:

```yaml
deployment:
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 0
      maxUnavailable: 50%
```

You can also change the type of update strategy to `Recreate`, but be careful as it will kill all pods before scheduling new ones, and the web UI will be unavailable until the new pods are started. In this case, you don't need to define `rollingUpdate`, only `type`:

```yaml
deployment:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
```

For more details, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#strategy).

### TLS

A Webservice pod runs two containers:

- `gitlab-workhorse`
- `webservice`

#### `gitlab-workhorse`

Workhorse supports TLS for both web and metrics endpoints. This will secure the
communication between Workhorse and other components, in particular `nginx-ingress`,
`gitlab-shell`, and `gitaly`. The TLS certificate should include the Workhorse
Service host name (e.g. `RELEASE-webservice-default.default.svc`) in the Common
Name (CN) or Subject Alternate Name (SAN).

Note that [multiple deployments of Webservice](#deployments-settings) can exist,
so you need to prepare the TLS certificate for different service names. This
can be achieved by either multiple SAN or wildcard certificate.

Once the TLS certificate is generated, create a [Kubernetes TLS Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets) for it. You also need to create
another Secret that only contains the CA certificate of the TLS certificate
with `ca.crt` key.

The TLS can be enabled for `gitlab-workhorse` container by setting `global.workhorse.tls.enabled`
to `true`. You can pass custom Secret names to `gitlab.webservice.workhorse.tls.secretName` and
`global.certificates.customCAs` accordingly.

When `gitlab.webservice.workhorse.tls.verify` is `true` (it is by default), you
also need to pass the CA certificate Secret name to `gitlab.webservice.workhorse.tls.caSecretName`.
This is necessary for self-signed certificates and custom CA. This Secret is used
by NGINX to verify the TLS certificate of Workhorse.

```yaml
global:
  workhorse:
    tls:
      enabled: true
  certificates:
    customCAs:
      - secret: gitlab-workhorse-ca
gitlab:
  webservice:
    workhorse:
      tls:
        verify: true
        # secretName: gitlab-workhorse-tls
        caSecretName: gitlab-workhorse-ca
      monitoring:
        exporter:
          enabled: true
          tls:
            enabled: true
```

TLS on the metrics endpoints of the `gitlab-workhorse` container is inherited from
`global.workhorse.tls.enabled`. Note that TLS on metrics endpoint is only available
when TLS is enabled for Workhorse. The metrics listener uses the same TLS certificate
that is specified by `gitlab.webservice.workhorse.tls.secretName`.

TLS certificates used for metrics endpoints may require additional considerations for
the included subject alternative names (SANs), particularly if using the included Prometheus
Helm chart. For more information, see [Configure Prometheus to scrape TLS-enabled endpoints](../../../installation/tools.md#configure-prometheus-to-scrape-tls-enabled-endpoints).

#### `webservice`

The primary use case for enabling TLS is to provide encryption via HTTPS
for [scraping Prometheus metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.html).

For Prometheus to scrape the `/metrics/` endpoint using HTTPS, additional
configuration is required for the certificate's `CommonName` attribute or
a `SubjectAlternativeName` entry. See
[Configuring Prometheus to scrape TLS-enabled endpoints](../../../installation/tools.md#configure-prometheus-to-scrape-tls-enabled-endpoints)
for those requirements.

TLS can be enabled on the `webservice` container by the settings `gitlab.webservice.tls.enabled`:

```yaml
gitlab:
  webservice:
    tls:
      enabled: true
      # secretName: gitlab-webservice-tls
```

`secretName` must point to a [Kubernetes TLS secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets).
For example, to create a TLS secret with a local certificate and key:

```shell
kubectl create secret tls <secret name> --cert=path/to/puma.crt --key=path/to/puma.key
```

## Using the Community Edition of this chart

By default, the Helm charts use the Enterprise Edition of GitLab. If desired, you
can use the Community Edition instead. Learn more about the
[differences between the two](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/).

In order to use the Community Edition, set `image.repository` to
`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-webservice-ce` and `workhorse.image`
to `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-workhorse-ce`.

## Global settings

We share some common global settings among our charts. See the [Globals Documentation](../../globals.md)
for common configuration options, such as GitLab and Registry hostnames.

## Deployments settings

This chart has the ability to create multiple Deployment objects and their related
resources. This feature allows requests to the GitLab application to be distributed between multiple sets of Pods using path based routing.

The keys of this Map (`default` in this example) are the "name" for each. `default`
will have a Deployment, Service, HorizontalPodAutoscaler, PodDisruptionBudget, and
optional Ingress created with `RELEASE-webservice-default`.

Any property not provided will inherit from the `gitlab-webservice` chart defaults.

```yaml
deployments:
  default:
    ingress:
      path: # Does not inherit or default. Leave blank to disable Ingress.
      pathType: Prefix
      provider: nginx
      annotations:
        # inherits `ingress.anntoations`
      proxyConnectTimeout: # inherits `ingress.proxyConnectTimeout`
      proxyReadTimeout:    # inherits `ingress.proxyReadTimeout`
      proxyBodySize:       # inherits `ingress.proxyBodySize`
    deployment:
      annotations: # map
      labels: # map
      # inherits `deployment`
    pod:
      labels: # additional labels to .podLabels
      annotations: # map
        # inherit from .Values.annotations
    service:
      labels: # additional labels to .serviceLabels
      annotations: # additional annotations to .service.annotations
        # inherits `service.annotations`
    hpa:
      minReplicas: # defaults to .minReplicas
      maxReplicas: # defaults to .maxReplicas
      metrics: # optional replacement of HPA metrics definition
      # inherits `hpa`
    pdb:
      maxUnavailable: # inherits `maxUnavailable`
    resources: # `resources` for `webservice` container
      # inherits `resources`
    workhorse: # map
      # inherits `workhorse`
    extraEnv: #
      # inherits `extraEnv`
    extraEnvFrom: #
      # inherits `extraEnvFrom`
    puma: # map
      # inherits `puma`
    workerProcesses: # inherits `workerProcesses`
    shutdown:
      # inherits `shutdown`
    nodeSelector: # map
      # inherits `nodeSelector`
    tolerations: # array
      # inherits `tolerations`
```

### Deployments Ingress

Each `deployments` entry will inherit from chart-wide [Ingress settings](#ingress-settings). Any value presented here will override those provided there. Outside of `path`, all settings are identical to those.

```yaml
webservice:
  deployments:
    default:
      ingress:
        path: /
   api:
     ingress:
       path: /api
```

The `path` property is directly populated into the Ingress's `path` property, and allows one to control URI paths which are directed to each service. In the example above,
`default` acts as the catch-all path, and `api` received all traffic under `/api`

You can disable a given Deployment from having an associated Ingress resource created by setting `path` to empty. See below, where `internal-api` will never receive external traffic.

```yaml
webservice:
  deployments:
    default:
      ingress:
        path: /
   api:
     ingress:
       path: /api
   internal-api:
     ingress:
       path:
```

### annotations

`annotations` is used to set annotations on the Webservice Ingress.

We set one annotation by default: `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream: "true"`.
This helps balance traffic to the Webservice pods more evenly by telling NGINX to directly
contact the Service itself as the upstream. For more information, see the
[NGINX docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/nginx-0.21.0/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#service-upstream).

To override this, set:

```yaml
gitlab:
  webservice:
    ingress:
      annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream: "false"
```

### proxyBodySize

`proxyBodySize` is used to set the NGINX proxy maximum body size. This is commonly
required to allow a larger Docker image than the default.
It is equivalent to the `nginx['client_max_body_size']` configuration in a
[Linux package installation](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/nginx.html#request-entity-too-large).
As an alternative option,
you can set the body size with either of the following two parameters too:

- `gitlab.webservice.ingress.annotations."nginx\.ingress\.kubernetes\.io/proxy-body-size"`
- `global.ingress.annotations."nginx\.ingress\.kubernetes\.io/proxy-body-size"`

### Extra Ingress

An extra Ingress can be deployed by setting `extraIngress.enabled=true`. The Ingress
is named as the default Ingress with the `-extra` suffix and supports the same
settings as the default Ingress.

## Resources

### Memory requests/limits

Each pod spawns an amount of workers equal to `workerProcesses`, who each use
some baseline amount of memory. We recommend:

- A minimum of 1.25GB per worker (`requests.memory`)
- A maximum of 1.5GB per worker, plus 1GB for the primary (`limits.memory`)

Note that required resources are dependent on the workload generated by users
and may change in the future based on changes or upgrades in the GitLab application.

Default:

```yaml
workerProcesses: 2
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 2.5G # = 2 * 1.25G
# limits:
#   memory: 4G   # = (2 * 1.5G) + 950M
```

With 4 workers configured:

```yaml
workerProcesses: 4
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 5G   # = 4 * 1.25G
# limits:
#   memory: 7G   # = (4 * 1.5G) + 950M
```

| `api.protocol`       | String  |                 | The protocol Webservice should use to reach the Registry API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `api.serviceName`    | String  | `registry`      | The name of the `service` which is operating the Registry server. If this is present, and `api.host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service (and current `.Release.Name`) in place of the `api.host` value. This is convenient when using Registry as a part of the overall GitLab chart.   |
| `certificate.key`    | String  |                 | The name of the `key` in the `Secret` which houses the certificate bundle that will be provided to the [registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry/) container as `auth.token.rootcertbundle`.                                                                                                                  |
| `certificate.secret` | String  |                 | The name of the [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) that houses the certificate bundle to be used to verify the tokens created by the GitLab instance(s).                                                                                                             |
| `host`               | String  |                 | The external hostname to use for providing Docker commands to users in the GitLab UI. Falls back to the value set in the `registry.hostname` template. Which determines the registry hostname based on the values set in `global.hosts`. See the [Globals Documentation](../../globals.md) for more information. |
| `port`               | Integer |                 | The external port used in the hostname. Using port `80` or `443` will result in the URLs being formed with `http`/`https`. Other ports will all use `http` and append the port to the end of hostname, for example `http://registry.example.com:8443`.                                                           |
| `tokenIssuer`        | String  | `gitlab-issuer` | The name of the auth token issuer. This must match the name used in the Registry's configuration, as it incorporated into the token when it is sent. The default of `gitlab-issuer` is the same default we use in the Registry chart.                                                                            |

## Chart settings

The following values are used to configure the Webservice Pods.

| Name              |  Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------- | :-----: | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `replicaCount`    | Integer | `1`     | The number of Webservice instances to create in the deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `workerProcesses` | Integer | `2`     | The number of Webservice workers to run per pod. You must have at least `2` workers available in your cluster in order for GitLab to function properly. Note that increasing the `workerProcesses` will increase the memory required by approximately `400MB` per worker, so you should update the pod `resources` accordingly. |

### Metrics

Metrics can be enabled with the `metrics.enabled` value and use the GitLab
monitoring exporter to expose a metrics port. Pods are either given Prometheus
annotations or if `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled` is `true` a Prometheus
Operator ServiceMonitor is created. Metrics can alternativly be scraped from
the `/-/metrics` endpoint, but this requires [GitLab Prometheus metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.html)
to be enabled in the Admin area. The GitLab Workhorse metrics can also be
exposed via `workhorse.metrics.enabled` but these can't be collected using the
Prometheus annotations so either require
`workhorse.metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled` to be `true` or external Prometheus
configuration.

### GitLab Shell

GitLab Shell uses an Auth Token in its communication with Webservice. Share the token
with GitLab Shell and Webservice using a shared Secret.

```yaml
shell:
  authToken:
    secret: gitlab-shell-secret
    key: secret
  port:
```

| Name               |  Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                   |
| :----------------- | :-----: | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `authToken.key`    | String  |         | Defines the name of the key in the secret (below) that contains the authToken.                                |
| `authToken.secret` | String  |         | Defines the name of the Kubernetes `Secret` to pull from.                                                     |
| `port`             | Integer | `22`    | The port number to use in the generation of SSH URLs within the GitLab UI. Controlled by `global.shell.port`. |

### WebServer options

Current version of chart supports Puma web server.

Puma unique options:

| Name                   |  Type   | Default | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :-----: | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `puma.workerMaxMemory` | Integer |         | The maximum memory (in megabytes) for the Puma worker killer |
| `puma.threads.min`     | Integer | `4`     | The minimum amount of Puma threads                           |
| `puma.threads.max`     | Integer | `4`     | The maximum amount of Puma threads                           |

## Configuring the `networkpolicy`

This section controls the
[NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).
This configuration is optional and is used to limit Egress and Ingress of the
Pods to specific endpoints.

| Name              |  Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------- | :-----: | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enabled`         | Boolean | `false` | This setting enables the `NetworkPolicy`                                                                                                                                        |
| `ingress.enabled` | Boolean | `false` | When set to `true`, the `Ingress` network policy will be activated. This will block all Ingress connections unless rules are specified.                                         |
| `ingress.rules`   |  Array  | `[]`    | Rules for the Ingress policy, for details see <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#the-networkpolicy-resource> and the example below      |
| `egress.enabled`  | Boolean | `false` | When set to `true`, the `Egress` network policy will be activated. This will block all egress connections unless rules are specified.                                           |
| `egress.rules`    |  Array  | `[]`    | Rules for the egress policy, these for details see <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#the-networkpolicy-resource> and the example below |

### Example Network Policy

The webservice service requires Ingress connections for only the Prometheus
exporter if enabled and traffic coming from the NGINX Ingress, and typically
requires Egress connections to various places. This examples adds the following
network policy:

- All Ingress requests from the network on TCP `10.0.0.0/8` port 8080 are allowed for metrics exporting and NGINX Ingress
- All Ingress requests to port 8181 are allowed for general service operation
- All Egress requests to the network on UDP `10.0.0.0/8` port 53 are allowed for DNS
- All Egress requests to the network on TCP `10.0.0.0/8` port 5432 are allowed for PostgreSQL
- All Egress requests to the network on TCP `10.0.0.0/8` port 6379 are allowed for Redis
- All Egress requests to the network on TCP `10.0.0.0/8` port 8075 are allowed for Gitaly
- Other Egress requests to the local network on `10.0.0.0/8` are restricted
- Egress requests outside of the `10.0.0.0/8` are allowed

_Note the example provided is only an example and may not be complete_

_Note the Webservice requires outbound connectivity to the public internet
for images on [external object storage](../../../advanced/external-object-storage)_

```yaml
networkpolicy:
  enabled: true
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - from:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
        ports:
        - port: 8080
      - from:
        ports:
        - port: 8181
  egress:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
        ports:
        - port: 53
          protocol: UDP
      - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
        ports:
        - port: 5432
          protocol: TCP
      - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
        ports:
        - port: 6379
          protocol: TCP
      - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
        ports:
        - port: 8075
          protocol: TCP
      - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
            except:
            - 10.0.0.0/8
```

### LoadBalancer Service

If the `service.type` is set to `LoadBalancer`, you can optionally specify `service.loadBalancerIP` to create
the `LoadBalancer` with a user-specified IP (if your cloud provider supports it).

When the `service.type` is set to `LoadBalancer` you must also set `service.loadBalancerSourceRanges` to restrict
the CIDR ranges that can access the `LoadBalancer` (if your cloud provider supports it).
This is currently required due to an issue where [metric ports are exposed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2500).

Additional information about the `LoadBalancer` service type can be found in
[the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#loadbalancer)

```yaml
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadBalancerIP: 1.2.3.4
  loadBalancerSourceRanges:
  - 10.0.0.0/8
```

## Configuring KEDA

This `keda` section enables the installation of [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) `ScaledObjects` instead of regular `HorizontalPodAutoscalers`.
This configuration is optional and can be used when there is a need for autoscaling based on custom or external metrics.

Most settings default to the values set in the `hpa` section where applicable.

If the following are true, CPU and memory triggers are added automatically based on the CPU and memory thresholds set in the `hpa` section:

- `triggers` is not set.
- The corresponding `request.cpu.request` or `request.memory.request` setting is also set to a non-zero value.

If no triggers are set, the `ScaledObject` is not created.

Refer to the [KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/2.10/concepts/scaling-deployments/) for more details about those settings.

| Name                            | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
