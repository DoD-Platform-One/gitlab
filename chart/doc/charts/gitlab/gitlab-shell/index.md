# Using the GitLab Shell chart **(FREE SELF)**

The `gitlab-shell` sub-chart provides an SSH server configured for Git SSH access to GitLab.

## Requirements

This chart depends on access to the Workhorse services, either as part of the
complete GitLab chart or provided as an external service reachable from the Kubernetes
cluster this chart is deployed onto.

## Design Choices

In order to easily support SSH replicas, and avoid using shared storage for the SSH
authorized keys, we are using the SSH [AuthorizedKeysCommand](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#AuthorizedKeysCommand)
to authenticate against the GitLab authorized keys endpoint. As a result, we don't persist
or update the AuthorizedKeys file within these pods.

## Configuration

The `gitlab-shell` chart is configured in two parts: [external services](#external-services),
and [chart settings](#chart-settings). The port exposed through Ingress is configured
with `global.shell.port`, and defaults to `22`. The Service's external port is also
controlled by `global.shell.port`.

## Chart configuration examples

### extraEnv

`extraEnv` allows you to expose additional environment variables in all containers in the pods.

Below is an example use of `extraEnv`:

```yaml
extraEnv:
  SOME_KEY: some_value
  SOME_OTHER_KEY: some_other_value
```

When the container is started, you can confirm that the environment variables are exposed:

```shell
env | grep SOME
SOME_KEY=some_value
SOME_OTHER_KEY=some_other_value
```

### extraEnvFrom

`extraEnvFrom` allows you to expose additional environment variables from other data sources in all containers in the pods.

Below is an example use of `extraEnvFrom`:

```yaml
extraEnvFrom:
  MY_NODE_NAME:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: spec.nodeName
  MY_CPU_REQUEST:
    resourceFieldRef:
      containerName: test-container
      resource: requests.cpu
  SECRET_THING:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: special-secret
      key: special_token
      # optional: boolean
  CONFIG_STRING:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: useful-config
      key: some-string
      # optional: boolean
```

### image.pullSecrets

`pullSecrets` allows you to authenticate to a private registry to pull images for a pod.

Additional details about private registries and their authentication methods can be
found in [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod).

Below is an example use of `pullSecrets`:

```yaml
image:
  repository: my.shell.repository
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: Always
  pullSecrets:
  - name: my-secret-name
  - name: my-secondary-secret-name
```

### livenessProbe/readinessProbe

`deployment.livenessProbe` and `deployment.readinessProbe` provide a mechanism
to help control the termination of Pods under some scenarios.

Larger repositories benefit from tuning liveness and readiness probe
times to match their typical long-running connections. Set readiness
probe duration shorter than liveness probe duration to minimize
potential interruptions during `clone` and `push` operations. Increase
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` and give these operations more time before
the scheduler terminates the pod. Consider the example below as a starting
point to tune GitLab Shell pods for increased stability and efficiency
with larger repository workloads.

```yaml
deployment:
  livenessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 20
    timeoutSeconds: 3
    successThreshold: 1
    failureThreshold: 10
  readinessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 5
    timeoutSeconds: 2
    successThreshold: 1
    failureThreshold: 3
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 300
```

Reference the official [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)
for additional details regarding this configuration.

### tolerations

`tolerations` allow you schedule pods on tainted worker nodes

Below is an example use of `tolerations`:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "node_label"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
- key: "node_label"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoExecute"
```

### annotations

`annotations` allows you to add annotations to the GitLab Shell pods.

Below is an example use of `annotations`

```yaml
annotations:
  kubernetes.io/example-annotation: annotation-value
```

## External Services

This chart should be attached the Workhorse service.

### Workhorse

```yaml
workhorse:
  host: workhorse.example.com
  serviceName: webservice
  port: 8181
```

| Name          |  Type   | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------ | :-----: | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host`        | String  |              | The hostname of the Workhorse server. This can be omitted in lieu of `serviceName`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `port`        | Integer | `8181`       | The port on which to connect to the Workhorse server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `serviceName` | String  | `webservice` | The name of the `service` which is operating the Workhorse server. By default, Workhorse is a part of the webservice Pods / Service. If this is present, and `host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service (and current `.Release.Name`) in place of the `host` value. This is convenient when using Workhorse as a part of the overall GitLab chart. |

## Chart settings

The following values are used to configure the GitLab Shell Pods.

### hostKeys.secret

The name of the Kubernetes `secret` to grab the SSH host keys from. The keys in the
secret must start with the key names `ssh_host_` in order to be used by GitLab Shell.

### authToken

GitLab Shell uses an Auth Token in its communication with Workhorse. Share the token
with GitLab Shell and Workhorse using a shared Secret.

```yaml
authToken:
 secret: gitlab-shell-secret
 key: secret
```

| Name               |  Type  | Default | Description                                                           |
| :----------------- | :----: | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken.key`    | String |         | The name of the key in the above secret that contains the auth token. |
| `authToken.secret` | String |         | The name of the Kubernetes `Secret` to pull from.                     |

### LoadBalancer Service

If the `service.type` is set to `LoadBalancer`, you can optionally specify `service.loadBalancerIP` to create
the `LoadBalancer` with a user-specified IP (if your cloud provider supports it).

You can also optionally specify a list of `service.loadBalancerSourceRanges` to restrict
the CIDR ranges that can access the `LoadBalancer` (if your cloud provider supports it).

Additional information about the `LoadBalancer` service type can be found in
[the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#loadbalancer)

```yaml
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadBalancerIP: 1.2.3.4
  loadBalancerSourceRanges:
  - 5.6.7.8/32
  - 10.0.0.0/8
```

### Configuring the `networkpolicy`

This section controls the
[NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).
This configuration is optional and is used to limit Egress and Ingress of the
Pods to specific endpoints.

| Name              |  Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------- | :-----: | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enabled`         | Boolean | `false` | This setting enables the `NetworkPolicy`                                                                                                                                        |
| `ingress.enabled` | Boolean | `false` | When set to `true`, the `Ingress` network policy will be activated. This will block all Ingress connections unless rules are specified.                                         |
| `ingress.rules`   |  Array  | `[]`    | Rules for the Ingress policy, for details see <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#the-networkpolicy-resource> and the example below      |
| `egress.enabled`  | Boolean | `false` | When set to `true`, the `Egress` network policy will be activated. This will block all egress connections unless rules are specified.                                           |
| `egress.rules`    |  Array  | `[]`    | Rules for the egress policy, these for details see <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#the-networkpolicy-resource> and the example below |

### Example Network Policy

The `gitlab-shell` service requires Ingress connections for port 22 and Egress
connections to various to default workhorse port 8181. This examples adds the
following network policy:

- All Ingress requests from the network on TCP `0.0.0.0/0` port 2222 are allowed
- All Egress requests to the network on UDP `10.0.0.0/8` port 53 are allowed for DNS
- All Egress requests to the network on TCP `10.0.0.0/8` port 8181 are allowed for Workhorse
- All Egress requests to the network on TCP `10.0.0.0/8` port 8075 are allowed for Gitaly

_Note the example provided is only an example and may not be complete_

```yaml
networkpolicy:
  enabled: true
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - from:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
        ports:
          - port: 2222
            protocol: TCP
  egress:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
        ports:
          - port: 8181
            protocol: TCP
          - port: 8075
            protocol: TCP
          - port: 53
            protocol: UDP
```

## Configuring KEDA

This `keda` section enables the installation of [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) `ScaledObjects` instead of regular `HorizontalPodAutoscalers`.
This configuration is optional and can be used when there is a need for autoscaling based on custom or external metrics.

Most settings default to the values set in the `hpa` section where applicable.

If the following are true, CPU and memory triggers are added automatically based on the CPU and memory thresholds set in the `hpa` section:

- `triggers` is not set.
- The corresponding `request.cpu.request` or `request.memory.request` setting is also set to a non-zero value.

If no triggers are set, the `ScaledObject` is not created.

Refer to the [KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/2.10/concepts/scaling-deployments/) for more details about those settings.
