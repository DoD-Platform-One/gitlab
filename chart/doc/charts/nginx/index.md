# Using NGINX **(FREE SELF)**

We provide a complete NGINX deployment to be used as an Ingress Controller. Not all
Kubernetes providers natively support the NGINX [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls),
to ensure compatibility.

NOTE:
Our [fork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/tree/master/charts/nginx-ingress) of the NGINX chart was pulled from
[GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx). See [Our NGINX fork](fork.md) for details on what was modified in our fork.

NOTE:
Only one `global.hosts.domain` value is possible.
Support for multiple domains is being tracked in [issue 3147](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3147).

## Configuring NGINX

See [NGINX chart documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/blob/master/charts/nginx-ingress/README.md#configuration)
for configuration details.

### Global settings

We share some common global settings among our charts. See the [Globals Documentation](../globals.md)
for common configuration options, such as GitLab and Registry hostnames.

## Configure hosts using the Global settings

The hostnames for the GitLab Server and the Registry Server can be configured using
our [Global settings](../globals.md) chart.

## GitLab Geo

A second NGINX subchart is bundled and preconfigured for GitLab Geo traffic,
which supports the same settings as the default controller. The controller can be
enabled with `nginx-ingress-geo.enabled=true`.

This controller is configured to not modify any incoming `X-Forwarded-*` headers.
Make sure to do the same if you want to use a different provider for Geo traffic.

The default controller value (`nginx-ingress-geo.controller.ingressClassResource.controllerValue`)
is set to `k8s.io/nginx-ingress-geo` and the IngressClass name to `{ReleaseName}-nginx-geo`
to avoid interference with the default controller. The IngressClass name can be overridden
with `global.geo.ingressClass`.

The custom header handling is only required for primary Geo sites to handle traffic
forwarded from secondary sites. It only needs to be used on secondaries if the
site is about to be promoted to a primary.

Note, that changing the IngressClass during a failover will cause the other controller
to handle incoming traffic. Since the other controller has a different loadbalancer IP
assigned, this may require additional changes to your DNS configuration.

This can be avoided by enabling the Geo Ingress controller on all Geo sites and
by configuring default and extra webservice Ingresses to use the associated
IngressClass (`useGeoClass=true`).

## Annotation value word blocklist

> Introduced in [GitLab Helm chart 6.6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2713).

In situations where cluster operators need greater control over the generated
NGINX configuration, the NGINX Ingress allows for [configuration snippets](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/customization/configuration-snippets/)
which inserts "snippets" of raw NGINX configuration not addressed by the
standard annotations and ConfigMap entries.

The drawback of these configuration snippets is that it allows cluster
operators to deploy Ingress objects that include LUA scripting and similar
configurations that can compromise the security of your GitLab installation
and the cluster itself, including exposing serviceaccount tokens and secrets.

See [CVE-2021-25742](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25742) and
[this upstream `ingress-nginx` issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837)
for additional details.

In order to mitigate CVE-2021-25742 in Helm chart deployments of GitLab - we
set an [annotation-value-word-blocklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/blob/v6.6.0/values.yaml#L836)
using the [suggested settings from the `nginx-ingress` community](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#annotation-value-word-blocklist)

If you are making use of configuration snippets in your GitLab Ingress
configuration, or are using GitLab NGINX Ingress Controller with third-party
Ingress objects that use configuration snippets, you may experience `404`
errors when trying to visit your GitLab third-party domains and "invalid word"
errors in your `nginx-controller` logs. In that case, review and adjust your
`nginx-ingress.controller.config.annotation-value-word-blocklist` setting.

See also ["Invalid Word" errors in the `nginx-controller` logs and `404` errors in our chart troubleshooting docs](../../troubleshooting/index.md#invalid-word-errors-in-the-nginx-controller-logs-and-404-errors).
