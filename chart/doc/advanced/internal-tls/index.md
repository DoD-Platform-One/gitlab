# Use TLS between components of the GitLab chart

The GitLab charts can use transport-layer security (TLS) between the various
components. This requires you to provide certificates for the services
you want to enable, and configure those services to make use of those
certificates and the certificate authority (CA) that signed them.

## Preparation

Each chart has documentation regarding enabling TLS for that service, and the various
settings required to ensure that appropriate configuration.

### Generating certificates for internal use

NOTE:
GitLab does not purport to provide high-grade PKI infrastructure, or certificate
authorities.

For the purposes of this documentation, we provide a **Proof of Concept** script
below, which makes use of [Cloudflare's CFSSL](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/)
to produce a self-signed Certificate Authority, and a wildcard certificate that can be
used for all services.

This script will:

- Generate a CA key pair.
- Sign a certificate meant to service all GitLab component service endpoints.
- Create two Kubernetes Secret objects:
  - A secret of type `kuberetes.io/tls` which has the server certificate and key pair.
  - A secret of type `Opaque` which **only** contains the public certificate of the CA as `ca.crt`
    as need by NGINX Ingress.

Prerequisites:

- Bash, or compatible shell.
- `cfssl` is available to your shell, and within `PATH`.
- `kubectl` is available, and configured to point to your Kubernetes cluster
  where GitLab will later be installed.
  - Be sure to have created the namespace you wish to have these certificates
    installed into before operating the script.

You may copy the content of this script to your computer, and make the resulting
file executable. We suggest `poc-gitlab-internal-tls.sh`.

```shell
#!/bin/bash
set -e
#############
## make and change into a working directory
pushd $(mktemp -d)

#############
## setup environment
NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE:-default}
RELEASE=${RELEASE:-gitlab}
## stop if variable is unset beyond this point
set -u
## known expected patterns for SAN
CERT_SANS="*.${NAMESPACE}.svc,${RELEASE}-metrics.${NAMESPACE}.svc,*.${RELEASE}-gitaly.${NAMESPACE}.svc"

#############
## generate default CA config
cfssl print-defaults config > ca-config.json
## generate a CA
echo '{"CN":"'${RELEASE}.${NAMESPACE}.internal.ca'","key":{"algo":"ecdsa","size":256}}' | \
  cfssl gencert -initca - | \
  cfssljson -bare ca -
## generate certificate
echo '{"CN":"'${RELEASE}.${NAMESPACE}.internal'","key":{"algo":"ecdsa","size":256}}' | \
  cfssl gencert -config=ca-config.json -ca=ca.pem -ca-key=ca-key.pem -profile www -hostname="${CERT_SANS}" - |\
  cfssljson -bare ${RELEASE}-services

#############
## load certificates into K8s
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} create secret tls ${RELEASE}-internal-tls \
  --cert=${RELEASE}-services.pem \
  --key=${RELEASE}-services-key.pem
kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} create secret generic ${RELEASE}-internal-tls-ca \
  --from-file=ca.crt=ca.pem
```

NOTE:
This script _does not_ preserve the CA's private key. It is a Proof-of-Concept
helper, and _is not intended for production use_.

The script expects two environment variables to be set:

1. `NAMESPACE`: The Kubernetes Namespace you will later install GitLab to.
  This defaults to `default`, as with `kubectl`.
1. `RELEASE`: The Helm Release name you will later use to install GitLab.
  This defaults to `gitlab`.

To operate this script, you may `export` the two variables, or prepend the
script name with their values.

```shell
export NAMESPACE=testing
export RELEASE=gitlab

./poc-gitlab-internal-tls.sh
```

After the script has run, you will find the two secrets created, and the
temporary working directory contains all certificates and their keys.

```plaintext
$ pwd
/tmp/tmp.swyMgf9mDs
$ kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get secret | grep internal-tls
testing-internal-tls      kubernetes.io/tls                     2      11s
testing-internal-tls-ca   Opaque                                1      10s
$ ls -1
ca-config.json
ca.csr
ca-key.pem
ca.pem
testing-services.csr
testing-services-key.pem
testing-services.pem
```

#### Required certificate CN and SANs

The various GitLab components speak to each other over their Service's DNS names.
The Ingress objects generated by the GitLab chart must provide NGINX the
name to verify, when `tls.verify: true` (which is the default). As a result
of this, each GitLab component should receive a certificate with a SAN including
either their Service's name, or a wildcard acceptable to the Kubernetes Service
DNS entry.

- `service-name.namespace.svc`
- `*.namespace.svc`

Failure to ensure these SANs within certificates _will_ result in a non-functional
instance, and logs that can be quite cryptic, refering to "connection failure"
or "SSL verification failed".

You can make use of `helm template` to retrieve a full list of all
Service object names, if needed. If your GitLab has been deployed without TLS,
you can query Kubernetes for those names:

`kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get service -lrelease=${RELEASE}`

## Configuration

Example configurations can be found in [examples/internal-tls](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/blob/master/examples/internal-tls/).

For the purposes of this documentation, we have provided `shared-cert-values.yaml`
which configures the GitLab components to consume the certificates generated with
the script above, in [generating certificates for internal use](#generating-certificates-for-internal-use).

Key items to configure:

1. Global [Custom Certificate Authorities](../../charts/globals.md#custom-certificate-authorities).
1. Per-component TLS for the service listeners.
  (See each chart's documentation, under [charts/](../../charts/index.md))

This process is greatly simplified by making use of YAML's native anchor
functionality. A truncated snippet of `shared-cert-values.yaml` shows this:

```yaml
.internal-ca: &internal-ca gitlab-internal-tls-ca
.internal-tls: &internal-tls gitlab-internal-tls

global:
  certificates:
    customCAs:
    - secret: *internal-ca
  workhorse:
    tls:
      enabled: true
gitlab:
  webservice:
    tls:
      secretName: *internal-tls
    workhorse:
       tls:
          verify: true # default
          secretName: *internal-tls
          caSecretName: *internal-ca
```

## Result

When all components have been configured to provide TLS on their service
listeners, all communication between GitLab components will traverse the
network with TLS security, including connections from NGINX Ingress to
each GitLab component.

NGINX Ingress will terminate any _inbound_ TLS, determine the appropriate
services to pass the traffic to, and then form a new TLS connection to
the GitLab component. When configured as shown here, it will also _verify_
the certificates served by the GitLab components against the CA.

This can be verified by connecting to the Toolbox pod, and querying the
various compontent Services. One such example, connecting to the Webservice
Pod's primary service port that NGINX Ingress uses:

```plaintext
$ kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get pod -lapp=toolbox,release=${RELEASE}
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
gitlab-toolbox-5c447bfdb4-pfmpc   1/1     Running   0          65m
$ kubectl exec -ti gitlab-toolbox-5c447bfdb4-pfmpc -c toolbox -- \
    curl -Iv "https://gitlab-webservice-default.testing.svc:8181"
```

The output should be similar to following example:

```plaintext
*   Trying 10.60.0.237:8181...
* Connected to gitlab-webservice-default.testing.svc (10.60.0.237) port 8181 (#0)

*  issuer: CN=gitlab.testing.internal.ca
*  SSL certificate verify ok.

```

## Troubleshooting

If your GitLab instance appears unreachable from the browser, by rendering an
HTTP 503 error, NGINX Ingress is likely having a problem verifying the
certificates of the GitLab components.

You may work around this by temporarily setting
`gitlab.webservice.workhorse.tls.verify` to `false`.

The NGINX Ingress controller can be connected to, and will evidence a message
in `nginx.conf`, regarding problems verifying the certificate(s).

Example content, where the Secret is not reachable:

```plaintext
# Location denied. Reason: "error obtaining certificate: local SSL certificate
  testing/gitlab-internal-tls-ca was not found"
return 503;
```

Common problems that cause this:

- CA certificate is not in a key named `ca.crt` within the Secret.
- The Secret was not properly supplied, or may not exist within the Namespace.
