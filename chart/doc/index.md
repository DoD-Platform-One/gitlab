# GitLab Helm chart **(FREE SELF)**

To install a cloud-native version of GitLab, use the GitLab Helm chart.
This chart contains all the required components to get started and can scale to large deployments.

For OpenShift-based installations, use [GitLab Operator](https://docs.gitlab.com/operator/),
otherwise you'll have to update the [security context constraints](https://docs.gitlab.com/operator/security_context_constraints.html)
yourself.

WARNING:
The default Helm chart configuration is **not intended for production**.
The default values will create an implementation where _all_ GitLab services are
deployed in the cluster, which is **not suitable for production workloads**.
For production deployments, you **must** follow the [Cloud Native Hybrid reference architectures](installation/index.md#use-the-reference-architectures).

For a production deployment, you should have strong working knowledge of Kubernetes.
This method of deployment has different management, observability, and concepts than traditional deployments.

The GitLab Helm chart is made up of multiple [subcharts](charts/gitlab/index.md),
each of which can be installed separately.
