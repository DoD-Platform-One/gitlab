# GitLab Helm chart **(FREE SELF)**

To install a cloud-native version of GitLab, use the GitLab Helm chart.
This chart contains all the required components to get started and can scale to large deployments.

WARNING:
The default Helm chart configuration is **not intended for production**.
The default chart creates a proof of concept (PoC) implementation where all GitLab
services are deployed in the cluster. For production deployments, additional setup and configuration is required.

For a production deployment, you should have strong working knowledge of Kubernetes.
This method of deployment has different management, observability, and concepts than traditional deployments.

The GitLab Helm chart is made up of multiple [subcharts](charts/gitlab/index.md),
each of which can be installed separately.
