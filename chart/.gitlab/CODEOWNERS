## Files that are excluded from required approval
## These rules override the * rule above, so that changes to docs and templates
## can be merged by any user who has maintainer rights, but is not included in
## the * rule (usually technical writers).

/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/*.md
/doc/*.md
/doc/**/*.md
/doc/**/*.jpg
/doc/**/*.png

## Technical writing files that do not need `*` rule approval,
## but still require an approval from a TW team DRI for each file.
